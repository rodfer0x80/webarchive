fixing online dating with ai

0. The problem at hand and hacking a solution
> Online dating sucks, it's difficult to find people that connect with you at
the same emotional level and thus finding a partner in this game is a lot of 
work mostly thrown out the window. It's still great for casual fun aka shagging
but nevertheless it's a lot of work to keep tabs on all the people you are
trying and recurrently shagging. We can make this better for everyone, for the 
fukbois and fukgirls we can remove most of the work and effort involved and
leave you with what matters, shagging. For the people looking for an actual 
partener we can also speed up this process and lift most of the work off your
shoulders so you can focus on meeting them irl, as some people for some weird
reason enjoy wasting their time on a stupid online app instead of trying to bond,
creating an emotional connection from there and understand if both work well together.
The limitations of this project remain people with no game or social skills
irl, the goal of this project is to smooth things up so you can spend less time
looking at a stupid screen wasting your time and your eyes to find an
acceptable match, or just for some casual fun, we are all at different stages
in our life. Now the product, a fine tuned AI bot that learns from your
personality in ~15 of talking to it and automates your experience and chatting
in a CMS you can arrange your matches from multiple platforms, communicate and
organise things so you can have more time to do something else more important,
like sleeping, masturbating or walking your dog (this last one is more
effective than online dating btw). In conclusion the goal of online dating
sites should be to get a date irl as soon and effortelessly as possible.
