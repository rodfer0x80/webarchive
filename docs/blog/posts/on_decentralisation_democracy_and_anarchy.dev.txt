1. Introduction
    AI is taking over.

2. LLM's
    Large Languale Models have existed for a while and have been the
centre of discourse in cutting edge AI. When GPT2 came out we saw 
the potencial that next word predication can have when a neural net
is trained on large amounts of data. But it was only when ChatGPT
came out that the world realised what is coming.
    A younger me would have been so excited now that more people
can learn and build stuff on their own, but that's not gonna happen,
we will still be pushing people to go to school, get indocrinated to
behave "approprialy", if you can call putting a child on a chair for
8h a day 5 days a week appropriate, to me it seems like abuse. We will
still have universities, maybe the teachers will even teach you how to
use ChatGTP for your assignments, better than not doing so tho. This is
just the beggining of the boost to decentralised learning. I have
learned almost everything from the internet and other individuals,
institutions are where you go to make some friends to party, hang around
and have some fun. Because when you are stuck to learning from you classes
and professors, no matter good you are, your progress will stop. 
You will need to pay 9k for some certificate or some shit like that 
where they teach you stuff. But if you can learn on your own, my friend
nobody can stop you, knowledge is freedom. You know what they used to say
"read books" and stuff like that? That's like don't forget to put the
horses back in the stable, our cars don't use hourses anymore, catch up dude.
Read the internet, go over some chapters in books that might teach you
something new, heck read humanities, that's cool you can understand better
how important language is for though production, expression and freedom. 
But ffs never stop learning on your own, being able to understand new
concepts based on a tree of knowledge is what is going to distinguish you
from an AI which has no deep understanding beyong what is most likely to be
the next work in this sentence. Master language and how to properly tell
stories, learn a craft and pick up some skills so you can sound interesting
when I told to you, if all you do it talk about football, TV shows,
fashion and the weather I am gonna tell you to stfu real fast. I do respect
people who understand the neat and gritty of story telling using digital media,
how to make the shooting look good and make some sick animations. Who I don't
respect is someone who will talk about superficial shit they seen in a TV show
and probly quickly change to some related drame in their lifes, idc dude. I am
cool with talking about both physical and mental health situation, emotions
about real life events that happen to you, I am happy to listen even if you
don't want or expect a solution to be thrown at the problem, something odd or
funny you saw or personal stuff about your past and future existance, 
we are all humans and this kind of conversations are good. Now what I don't 
care are 3rd parties problems, their dramas and their lifes, if I cared I would
be chatting to them, not you, I also can't stand human fabricated drama, if
there isn't an actual problem don' try to make one just to pass the time.
Go read some phylosophy and psycology and pick up some skills you might have
thought about but never did and then you will be in a state of mind where I
respect you, otherwise you are like a puppet to me, as I can see them pulling 
your strings and speaking for you.

3. You are gonna lose your job (maybe, what you doing with your time?)
    I imagine from a non technical point of view the normies
must be shitting their pants, change is scary, and disrupting
changes? Scary as fuck! Ignore can be a bliss when we are telling
people who care about politics to stfu, but when it comes to
Mathematics and Technology, ignore brings fear, one fears the
unknown, and that's understandable. We have seen this with
self-driving cars, eventought replacing manual labour jobs is
much harder, this audience is mainly technologically ignorant, 
and thus the uproaring. But when it comes to ChatGPT, I do 
believe the managereal class should be shitting their pants
for real. Unlike engineers, manual labour workers, customer
service and other professionals who's jobs isn't just
managing resources and collecting payments, the managereal
class hoards on real estate whick are necessary regardless of
their existance and securities like
people (yes, you slave), bonds, stocks, information, pokemon cards, etc. This things
have no real value, unlike houses, tho this is a ego and
cultural issue we will hopefully overcome soon.
    So what happens when your job is so little and depraved
from the benefit of other humans? We replace you. We replace you
with a cockroach sized brain in code (yes the comparison is quite accurate I
know). When your work doesn't produce a positive human interaction or
a final good that can be exchanged, your value is little. Customer service
jobs will be around for a long time until we manage to build good enough
physical and software systems to give you freedom and independance,
until then, what about increasing your pay by firing your most of your 
managers and replacing them with a LLM? 
    LLM's also don't understand shit and can't be santient, we
haven't figured out the algorithm yet, but it will be much simpler.
    So for now we can steer the wheel towards the utopia we would like
to be born in. Replace the charlatons with machines and increase
vital workers pay and maybe reduce their working hours too with the 
assistance of ever improving machines. Maybe this time, when the
productivity increases, instead of 100000x your bosses profit, we can
cut your work time in half and pay you 4x for your work.

3. This shit can still catch on fire in our doorstep
    It's all and good if we are not aware of history and how
centralised systems always reward the hoarders, thus AI, both
software and hardware should be open-sourced and individuals
should be encourage to build on top of others work, because
this is the only way we have a chance at destroying power.
Power is bad, power corrupts and power is imoral. Now one
reading this might be starting to thing this is just some
anarchist jiberish, but I would like to point out the problem
with Anarchy. It's violence, currently the states hold the
monopoly of violance inside their borders and globally the
US has the reins, but in an anarchist plot of land how to you deal
with violence, descentralised violence is no better than centralised
violence. Thus the proposed solution is to end all power, maybe in a distant
utopia, where power over people is no more and all that matters is power 
over nature, where we will be sharing compassion with eachothers, 
exploring space and experiencing life in a fully submerged simulation.
    Things can still go very wrong. If ir turns out we can't or fail to
build decentralised systems, we can laugh at 1984 while we fail to 
realise the dystopia we live in. We can already see how difficult it is
to understand reality when we are constantly bombarded by missinformation
and psycologically dark marketing stunts that deeped the pockets of those
in power. Take a look at what is happening with social progressivism, it's
all just a stunt, agiprop, you get the bucks from the naive progressives,
you get the free advertising from the raging conservatives and vice versa
when bigotted stunts are performed and tories give you their bucks
while lefties give you free raging advertising, and meanwhile no change 
take place, nobody cares, children in Asia dying to make your shoes but 
it's ok because Nike and Adidas are green. People in Pakistan drowning from floods,
but it's ok because BP and Shell are green now too! Should I even have
children, I mean why put them through so much pain? I didn't ask to be born,
don't want to be here but there is nowhere better to go. Healthcare getting
destroyed, housing prices going up, workers getting fed anti union propaganda,
poor people screaming at lefties because they have the hopes of one day, one
day becoming rich, and then it will all be worth it! Lies, it will never end,
you will always want more... 
    So yeah it turns out that all I want to do is build cool shit, but can't 
even have that. Gotta do what makes money, go do code the same shit over and
over, maybe you will get enough to become a VC one day, fuck off. We have never
been so isolated and uncopassionate towards eachothers. If I could house and
feed you all just to bankrupt Fox Estates and the Rockafella, but no way I 
will ever get the change to do so, it's going the other way around, they are
the ones bankrupting me while paying less taxes that the doctors, nurses and
cleaners who are vital members of our society while making more money doing 
three calls a day and answering to 5 emails in multiple orders
of magnitude in difference. Only when you live in a system that rewards
hoarding does property become a thing, noone is coming for you house when
they are fed, sleeping under a roof and working towards something meaningful,
even the most deranged from society can slowly change as we have seen with
Finland's prisional system, and exile is a brutal thing to do to someone
because of their skin colour it's cool to make you gtfo when you are 
physycal abuser or when you have no regard for other's lifes. 
    So yeah, let's stuff the managereal and political classes with their
own fiat currency and exile them to Rwanda along with other killers we can't help
and  abusers who refuse to be compassionate.

4. Conclusion
    Duck and hide or play along.
